The CS files in this folder are structered in specific ways to provide bits of data to check against.

- Characters
What Characters are allowed to be picked by the Randomiser for this stage. (Might change this to a blacklist rather than a whitelist?)

- NoBoss
The index values of enemy objects that shouldn't be made into a boss (assuming any are even selected for the Enemy Randomiser), due to them activating an event for progression (such as spawning a Light Dash) trail or opening a cage/door. Commander enemies are exempt from this check.

- RequiredProps
The index values of props that should be left alone so they don't block progression (such as Wave Ocean A's boardwalks), also contains what prop they should be.
